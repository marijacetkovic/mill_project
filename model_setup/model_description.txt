The transition model includes the following public methods:
* clone()
  Creates a deep copy of the object.

* get_state()
  Returns the board position as a list [0 - 23], containing values:
  0 (empty), 1 (player 1), 2 (player 2).
  Note: Board position 1 has index 0 in the list, etc.

* get_phase(player)
  Returns the phase of the given player (placing, moving, flying).

* count_pieces(player)
  Returns number of pieces on the board belonging to the given player.

* legal_moves(player)
  Returns the list of legal moves for the given player.

* make_move(player, move)
  Changes the state as if the given player made the given move.
  Note: The correctness of the move is not checked for performance
        reasons. The user should only make moves from the list of
        legal moves. Player's turn is also not checked. The same
        player can be simulated as making multiple consecutive moves.

* game_over()
  Return True if one of the player has lost the game.

Printing the transition model prints the board state in ASCII.
