    #   Creates a deep copy of the object.

    #   Returns the board position as a list [0 - 23], containing values:
    #   0 (empty), 1 (player 1), 2 (player 2).
    #   Note: Board position 1 has index 0 in the list, etc.
    #
    # * get_phase(player)
    #   Returns the phase of the given player (placing, moving, flying).
    #
    # * count_pieces(player)
    #   Returns number of pieces on the board belonging to the given player.
    #
    # * legal_moves(player)
    #   Returns the list of legal moves for the given player.
    #
    # * make_move(player, move)
    #   Changes the state as if the given player made the given move.
    #   Note: The correctnes of the move is not checked for performance
    #         reasons. The user should only make moves from the list of
    #         of legal moves. Player's turn is also not checked. The same
    #         player can be simulated as making multiple consecutive moves.
    #
    # * game_over()
    #   Return True if one of the player has lost the game.
